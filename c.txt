iswitch(expression) {
    case value1:
        // Code block for value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // Code block for value2
        break;
    default:
        // Code block for default (optional)
}


Explanation:
expression: This is the value or variable that you want to check against the various cases.

case value1: If the expression matches value1, the code block under this case is executed.

break: This keyword exits the switch statement once the matching case block is executed. Without it, the code continues to the next case even if there is a match (a phenomenon called "fall-through").

default: This block is optional. It runs if none of the specified cases match the expression.
